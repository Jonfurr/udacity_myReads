# MyReads Project

This app manages reading lists.  Books can be added to one of three shelves: 
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Books maintain there current shelf accross the main bookshelf page and search results.
Updating the shelf of a book from the search page or the bookshelf page maintains the shelf in both places.
